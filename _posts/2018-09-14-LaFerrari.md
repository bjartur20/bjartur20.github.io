The LaFerrari, project name F150 (also unofficially referred to as the Ferrari LaFerrari or Ferrari F70)[4] is a limited production hybrid sports car built by Italian automotive manufactuter Ferrari.[5] LaFerrari literally means "The Ferrari" in Italian and in some other Romance languages, in this context in the sense that it is the "definitive" Ferrari.
