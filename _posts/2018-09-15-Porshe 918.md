The Porsche 918 Spyder is a mid-engined plug-in hybrid sports car manufactured by German automobile manufacturer Porsche.[3] The Spyder is powered by a naturally aspirated 4.6 L (4,593 cc) V8 engine, developing 608 PS (447 kW; 600 bhp) at 8500 rpm, with two electric motors delivering an additional 210 kW (286 PS; 282 bhp) for a combined output of 887 PS (652 kW; 875 bhp) and 1,280 N⋅m (944 lbf⋅ft) of torque.[4][5] The 918 Spyder's 6.8 kWh lithium-ion battery pack delivers an all-electric range of 19 km (12 mi) under the US Environmental Protection Agency's five-cycle tests.[1]

Production began on September 18, 2013, with deliveries initially scheduled to begin in December 2013, and a starting price of ~ €611,000 (US$845,000 or GB£511,000).[6][7][8] The 918 Spyder was sold out in December 2014 and production ended in June 2015.[9]

The 918 Spyder was first shown as a concept at the 80th Geneva Motor Show in March 2010.[6] On July 28, 2010, after 2,000 declarations of interest, the Supervisory board of Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG, Stuttgart, approved series development of the 918 Spyder.[10] The production version was unveiled at the September 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show.[11] Porsche also unveiled the RSR racing variant of the 918 at the 2011 North American International Auto Show, which combines hybrid technology first used in the 997 GT3 R Hybrid, with styling from the 918 Spyder.[12] The 918 Spyder was the second plug-in hybrid car from Porsche, after the 2014 Panamera S E-Hybrid.[13]
